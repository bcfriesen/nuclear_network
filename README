This code calculates the time-dependent molar abundances Y_i of the 13 isotopes
involved in the CNO cycle. It's a work in progress, and I'm still learning so
some of it may be wrong (the beta-decay stuff in particular)...

Nuclear network ODEs are stiff because different isotopes react on enormously
different time scales. Resolving these changes without integrating over
absurdly small time steps is challenging. Fortunately some very smart applied
mathematicians have solved these sorts of problems for us.

This code integrates the nuclear network ODEs using the implicit Bulirsch-Stoer
method of Bader-Deuflhard, which is built into the GNU Scientific Library. (See
"Numerical Recipes" for detailed descriptions of these algorithms.)

I've only tested this code in Solar-ish environments. For reasonable results
try a temperature of 15 MK and a density of 150 g/cm^3. The initial abundances
should be mostly hydrogen, but since C12 catalyzes the hydrogen burning
sequence, you need a finite (albeit very small) amount of that too. If you use
these ballpark numbers, You should see the abundances change on timescales of ~
Gyr. These are roughly the lifetimes of stars on the main sequence so it makes
sense that the initial hydrogen depletes over this amount of time.
