This code calculates the time-dependent molar abundances Y_i of the 13 isotopes
involved in the CNO cycle. It's a work in progress, and I'm still learning so
some of it may be wrong (the beta-decay stuff in particular)...

Nuclear network ODEs are stiff because different isotopes react on enormously
different time scales. Resolving these changes without integrating over
absurdly small time steps is challenging. Fortunately some very smart applied
mathematicians have solved these sorts of problems for us.

This code integrates the nuclear network ODEs using the implicit Bulirsch-Stoer
method of Bader-Deuflhard, which is built into the GNU Scientific Library. (See
"Numerical Recipes" for detailed descriptions of these algorithms.)

I've not tested this code extensively except in Solar-ish environments. For
reasonable results try a temperature of 15 MK and a density of 150 g/cm^3. The
initial abundances should be mostly hydrogen, with at least a tiny bit of C12.
(In an earlier version of this code I spent 2 full days trying to figure out
why my abundances never changed over any amount of time. Turns out my initial
C12 abundances was zero. Oops.) You should see the abundances change on
timescales of ~ Gyr. These are roughly the lifetimes of stars on the main
sequence so it makes sense that the initial hydrogen depletes over this amount
of time.
