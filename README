This program calculates the time-dependent molar abundances Y_i of the 13
isotopes involved in the CNO cycle. It's a work in progress, and I'm still
learning so some of it may be wrong (the beta-decay stuff in particular)...

Right now it uses a 1st-order semi-implicit Euler method to perform the
integration. This is a bad choice because it gives you no error estimate. In the
near future I hope to implement Kaps-Rentrop(-Rosenberg?) and Bader-Deuflhard.
